What is Android Build Internal Library?
------------------------------------
Android Build service is used as a destination to upload test results and logs from
TF test runs. This is an autogenerated library for the Android Build API client.
The library is generated automatically from API definitions.

What is the difference between v2beta1 and v3?
-------------------------------------
Those are different versions of the library. V3 introduced some incompatible changes
and v3 library can't be used as a drop-in replacement. V3 library is compiled so that
it has a version number embedded in the pacakge name and it can be used alongside v2beta1.
